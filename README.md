# TIC-TAK-TOE
A TIK-TAK-TOE game we had already know how to play it, we played it atleast once in childhood so inted of using paper and pen try somthing new with technology and cheat free;)
In a game player turn start with player_X, if any player win or tie in next game turn goes to the player_O. Here is a dashbord to showcase the no of wins of each player which changes automatically according to the game result. 
There are two buttons to reset the game and exit the game, after winning a game you have to reset it again and if tie happens it automatically get reset.
